MADE: Repository for home assignments (Advanced C++ course)

## Home assignment #8 - Vector (STL-like implementation)

### Features
* It is a simple STL-like implementation of a template `Vector` class
* The following template classes were implemented:
    * `Allocator<T>` - a simple allocator that supports allocation with `new[]` and deallocation with `delete[]`
    * `Iterator<T>` - a custom random access iterator which supports all methods and traits required by STL
    * `Vector<T,Alloc>` - a vector class that supports only constructors (with reservation and filling in with default `T()` or specific value, for `std::initializer_list<T>`, copy-constructor and move-constructor), destructor, operators (assign and move-assign `=`, comparison `==` and `!=`, `[]`), methods `clear`, `reserve`, `resize`, `begin`, `end`, `rbegin`, `rend`, `push_back`, `pop_back`, `empty`, `size`, `capacity`)
* To use `Vector<T>`, it is neccessary to include `"Vector.h"` header
* Main functionality is covered by 339 assertions ([Header based catch2 library](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2))

### How to build and run
* `make` - to build both *vector* and *vector_test* 
* `make test` - to build and run tests
* `make run` - to build and run a simple sample
* `make clean` - to clean output
* `./build/vector` - to run a simple sample
* `./build/vector_test` - to run tests

## Home assignment #7 - Format (exceptions)

### Features
* Format function `Format(formatStr, args...)` was implemented in a way similar to Python/C# formating
* Arguments should be numberted and included in braces, for example: `"{0} + {1} = {3}"`
* According to assignment requirements symbols `'{'` and `'}'` cannot be used without parameter
* Function supports C++ types that can be saved to `std::stringstream` using `<<` operator
* Examples: 
    * `Format(" {0} Bjarne {0} ", "Stroustrup")` returns `" Stroustrup Bjarne Stroustrup "`
    * `Format("{0}, {1}, {2}", 4, 'a', "cdf")` returns `"4, a, cdf"`
* In order to use Format fuction, it neccessary to include `"format.h"` header file
* In the case of errors, fuction raizes `std::runtime_error` exception with appropriate message
* Main functionality is covered by 60 assertions ([Header based catch2 library](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2))

## Home assignment #6 - BigInt class (operations and C++ references)

### Features
* `BigInt` class supports the followint operation signs
    * unary `-`
    * binary `+` and `-` for both `BigInt` objects and `int`
    * comparison operators `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`, `==`, `!=` for both `BigInt` objects and `int`
* Different types of references were used in operations to support constant and temporary objects
* `BigInt` is based on the own vector implementation (template class `DynamicArray`) - requirement of assignment
* `BigInt` and `DynamicArray` implement "The rule of 5" (constructor, copy constructor, move constructor, assignment operator, move assignment)
* The size of `BigInt` and `DynamicArray` is limeted by RAM and `std::size_t`
* Main functionality is covered by 191 assertions ([Header based catch2 library](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2))

## Home assignment #5 - Serialization and templates

### Features
* `Serializer` and `Deserializer` classes are correspodingly for serialization into string and deserialization from it. 
* They support:
    * `ostream`/`istream` classes for storing serialization result or loading object from it 
    * functional operation `()` to pass parameters that are serialized
    * can serializer or deserialize objects of any classes that have at least one field and implement serialize method:
    ~~~
    struct Data {
        std::uint64_t a;
        bool b;
        std::uint64_t c;

        template <class Serializer>
        Error serialize(Serializer& serializer) {
            return serializer(a, b, c); // pass fields to serialize or deserialize here
        }
    
        template <class Serializer>
        Error serialize(Serializer& serializer) const { //this method is required to support constant objects for serialization
            return serializer(a, b, c);
        }
        ...
    }
    ~~~
